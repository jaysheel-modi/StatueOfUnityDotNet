Database:

The database is named "RegisteredUserDB" and contains two tables: "TicketBooking" and "RegisteredUser."
The "TicketBooking" table stores information about each ticket booking, such as TicketID, Name, Mobile, Email, NumberOfTickets, and TotalAmount.
The "RegisteredUser" table stores the email addresses of registered users.
The code interacts with the database using SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SQL queries to retrieve data and store new entries.
